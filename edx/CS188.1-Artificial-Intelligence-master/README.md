BerkeleyX: CS188.1x Artificial Intelligence
===========================================

*CS188x will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. A specific
emphasis will be on the statistical and decision-theoretic modeling paradigm. By the end of this course, you will have
built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and adversarial settings, draw inferences in
uncertain environments, and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures.*

This repository contains my solutions for the projects for the
[CS188.1x Artificial Intelligence](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS188.1x/2013_Spring/info) course on
